# What Is Beef Taco?

[Targeted Advertising Cookie Opt-Out (TACO)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11073/) is a Firefox plugin that jumped the shark.  In 3.0 they introduced a ton of cruft and crap.

To quote a review:

> Unbelievable how this very good Add-on (TACO 2.0) could fall so deep. The new version (3.0.x) is a nightmare. It's bloated (up to 3MB), slow and has a terrible Preference-dialog (more like a christmas tree).
>
> You are well-advised to avoid the new version and go back to 2.0. "Nightly Tester Tools" or/ and "MR Tech Toolkit" will help you to make it compatible. Or do it manual.
>
> I'm desperately disappointed.

Beef Taco is a fork of TACO v2.0, before the junk was added in, kept up to date with the most recent Firefox versions.
